		 * How to set up selenium in our editor??
		 * we have to create a project in the ide-intellij/eclipse
		 * It has java lib by default
		 * BUT does not have sel lib - so sel code cannot be written here
		 * So add sel libraries to the Project==> configure sel in the ide
		 * we have to create a maven prj 
		 * the main purpose of maven is? it gives a pom.xml file where we can add any lib/external/3rdpartylibs
		 * pom.xml file: is the config file provided by maven directly
		 * build:
		 * properties:
		 * groupId:
		 * artifactId:
		 * which we want to integrate with our code --like testng, log4j, apache poi api, extent, allure.....
		 * these do not come along with jdk
		 * 
		 * go to google and search for selenium maven dependency
		 * which is a global centralized repository--where all the open projects they provide their libs here
		 * 
		 * when creating maven project--the filter u have to apply is
		 * maven-archetype-quickstart
		 * 
		 * NavNotes:
		 * IDE - Eclipse/IntelliJ
		 * 
		 * config selenium in IDE
		 * 
		 * Maven Project:
		 * pom.xml --dependencies : selenium external libs
		 * 
		 * JRE 1.11 --> internal libs
		 * selenium --> external libs/3rd parties
		 * testNG/poi/allure/extent/log4j
		 *
